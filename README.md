#Bulk PDF to Image Converter – UiPath Automation


Having many PDFs? Want to convert them into images in one go? This UiPath automation does exactly that — fast and secure.

##⚙️ What This Project Does

This RPA bot automatically converts all PDFs in a folder into image files (e.g. JPG).
No need to upload them one by one manually — everything runs seamlessly using UiPath Automation.

##🚀 How to Use

Step 1 : Download this repository.

Step 2 : Open the project in UiPath Studio.

Step 3 : In Main.xaml, locate the two folder variables:

Step 4 : sourceFolder → Set this to the path where your PDF files are stored.

Step 5 : destinationFolder → Create and set a folder path where output images should be saved.

Step 6 : Run Main.xaml.

That’s it — all PDF pages will be exported as image files automatically.

##💡 Why I Built This
While completing a learning path on Infosys Springboard, I earned 19 certificates which are in PDF Format. To share them on LinkedIn, I wanted to convert each one to an image.

Instead of manually uploading/downloading each file to any online tool, I built this automation to batch-convert all of them in seconds.
