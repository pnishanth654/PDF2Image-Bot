## 💡 Why I Built This

While completing a learning path on Infosys Springboard, I earned 19 certificates in PDF format. To share them on LinkedIn, I wanted to convert each one to an image.

Instead of manually uploading/downloading each file to any online tool, I built this automation to batch-convert all of them in seconds.
